What is EDUGENIUS?
​EDUGENIUS is a fast-paced, interactive educational quiz platform. It is designed to test your knowledge across various academic and intellectual disciplines using a "timed pressure" mechanic.
​The app features a clean, modern interface with a glass-morphic design (blurred backgrounds) and dynamic feedback.
​Key Features:
​Diverse Subjects: Covers 10 distinct areas including Logic & Reasoning, Technology & AI, History, and the core Sciences.
​Timed Challenges: You only have 15 seconds per question, making it a test of both accuracy and speed.
​Instant Feedback: Unlike traditional tests, it shows you the correct answer and a brief educational explanation immediately after you answer.
​Randomization: Questions are shuffled every time you start, so no two sessions are exactly the same.
​Performance Tracking: A final scoring screen that rewards high achievers with a "Genius" status and virtual confetti.
​🛠 How to Use the Website
​Using the site is straightforward and follows a 3-step loop:
​1. Setup
​Select your Subject: When the page loads, you’ll see a dropdown menu. Click it to choose the topic you want to be tested on (e.g., "Logic & Reasoning" or "Physics").
​Start: Click the "Start Quiz" button to begin the session.
​2. The Quiz Phase
​Watch the Timer: A red bar at the top of the card will begin shrinking. You must pick an answer before it disappears.
​Select an Answer: Click on one of the four options.
​Green Highlight: You got it right!
​Red Highlight: You got it wrong (the correct answer will turn green automatically).
​Read the "Why": After answering, an explanation box appears at the bottom. This is great for learning the logic behind the answer.
​Progress: Click "Next Question →" to continue.
​3. Results & Review
​Once you finish all questions (usually 20-25 per category), the "Quiz Finished" screen appears.
​Score Calculation: You’ll see your total points and a percentage-based rank.
​Play Again: Click "Try Another Subject" to go back to the home screen and try a different category.
